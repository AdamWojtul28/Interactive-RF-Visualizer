# Interactive-RF-Visualizer

## Project Description

This repository contains work completed by Adam Wojtulewski with the help of Professor Albert D. Ritzhaupt, Professor Rong Zhang, and Professor Emmanuel Dorley as part of an Undergraduate Honors Thesis. This project involves the development of an interactive Random Forest Visualization Library that would allow users to explore individual sections (of nodes) in Decision Trees. Currently, it is imagined to be a combination of the existing Plotly and Graphviz Libraries. Moreover, in addition to being interactive, which would involve creating bounded boxes around areas of interest to Zoom in and Zoom out of them and generating dataframes and visualizations for subtrees, it is imagined to also incorporate validation techniques into the trees, with confusion matrix trees being the first in mind.

## Using the Code

The code in this Github was made using Anaconda Python, specifically JupyterLab.

## Progress Summary

For the first phase of the development from 9/16 - 9/30, the Jupyter Notebook for extracting the dataset and training the Random Forest was developed and the capabilities of visualization capabilities were explored.
