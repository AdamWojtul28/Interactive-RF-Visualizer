# Interactive-RF-Visualizer

## Project Description

This repository contains work completed by Adam Wojtulewski with the help of Professor Albert D. Ritzhaupt, Professor Rong Zhang, and Professor Emmanuel Dorley as part of an Undergraduate Honors Thesis. This project involves the development of an interactive Random Forest Visualization Library that would allow users to explore individual sections (of nodes) in Decision Trees. Currently, it is imagined to be a combination of the existing Plotly and Graphviz Libraries. Moreover, in addition to being interactive, which would involve creating bounded boxes around areas of interest to Zoom in and Zoom out of them and generating dataframes and visualizations for subtrees, it is imagined to also incorporate validation techniques into the trees, with confusion matrix trees being the first in mind.

## Using the Code

1)	The code in this Github was made using Anaconda Python, specifically JupyterLab. To use this code it is first necessary to download JupyterLab and Anaconda Python from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/download
2)	Install Git (which includes Git Bash) from this website: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
3)	Create a folder in your system to host the project.
4)	Open a CLI interface like Git Bash
5)	Within the folder that was just created, type the following: git clone https://github.com/AdamWojtul28/Interactive-RF-Visualizer.git
6)	Run Anaconda Navigator
7)	Run JupyterLab
8)	Complete the required library installations that are used to power this application, which can be completed in one of two ways. 
  a.	Run the cells in the notebook Decision_Tree_Visualizer.ipynb starting from the first cell. 
  b.	Open a terminal and run the following command pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn dash plotly ipywidgets9) 
9)	Run each line in the notebook either clicking on the Play Button in the software or with the Shift + Enter keyboard combination.
